-- Mourning 离思 --

曾经沧海难为水，
If you've experienced the rippling sea, you won't be attracted to water anywhere else
除却巫山不是云。
If you've been enchanted by the wind and cloud of Wushan, you won't be attracted to the clouds of other scenery
取次花丛懒回顾，
Even amidst all the flowers, I'm lazy to take another look.
半缘修道半缘君。
This is because, half of it the reason is due to a Tao cultivator's pure mind, and the half is because of the you that I once had.
